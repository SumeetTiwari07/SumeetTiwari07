### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Bioinformatician :man_technologist: at [Quadram Institute](https://quadram.ac.uk/) at Norwich, UK. I have expertise in analysing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data mainly bacteria.

I did my PhD at [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html), Berlin, Germany (2017-2021). My research work was focused on identifying the host-specific genomic determinants of E. coli, by applying a microbial genome-wide association study (GWAS). The study was performed on a diverse collection of ~ 1200 E. coli isoates. Link to [disseration](https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/33223)

In 2015, I finished my masterâ€™s in bioinformatics from [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/), India, followed by working as a Bioinformatics junior research fellow for two years in a lab focused on bacterial pathogens and genome based epidemiological studies. I was mainly working with WGS data and doing comparative genomics studies. In addition to that I also have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Biotechnology. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analysing Metagenomics data and visualization of results.
- ðŸŒ± Developing/integrating workflows.
